    I like to take ownership for things and make them really, really good. Solving difficult problems is where I shine, due to my ability to learn rapidly and think in terms of abstract concepts.

        A tool to create translations of sentences in foreign languages while providing grammatical explanations. Helpful to not only retrieve translations, but genuinely understand \textit{why} words are used in a certain why, particularly for strongly inflected languages (such as German). \\

        Additional features include the creation of inflection tables (such as declension or conjucation) for strongly inflected languages via custom fine-tuned large language models. \\

        The project consists of completely typed Python, with high test coverage, automated deployments and a cloud-native architecture.
